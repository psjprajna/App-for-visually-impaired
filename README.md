# App for the visually impaired
The app uses optical character recognition (OCR) to read text from pages and documents. 
It then converts the text into speech using text-to-speech (TTS) technology. 
The app can also detect and validate currency values. Additionally, the app can be used to send messages by simply saying the message aloud. 
This makes it a valuable tool for visually impaired people who need help reading and understanding text.
